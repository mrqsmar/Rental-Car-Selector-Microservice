    Information:

    - This program was made for people who are very curious on the car they selected from the website. I wanted to give you a clearer picture of what rental car you will get when you select your class. Despite having one class, some cars are much higher rated than another car.

    - My hope is that you get a sweet rental car or you can also negotiate yourself for a certain model if they do have one in stock.

    - Here are the codes once again for the rental car class that you may input:
    A, B, C, D, E, E6, F, G, H, H, V, Q4, L, L4, T, T6, R, O6, S, U, M, N4

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    NEW / UPCOMING FEATURES LIST: We are going to embed a Generative AI API so that the user can be able to be generated a random rental when they pick the class if they wish.
