You have hit the Extended SUV class. These get pretty bad fuel economy but tend to be 
more spacious and have more space than a typical 7 passenger SUV, but more than a Large SUV.
The offerings are the Chevrolet Suburban LT, Ford Expedition MAX XLT,
GMC Yukon XL SLT, and Jeep Wagoneer L III. These cars are all pretty good
but I would go with the Wagoneer. its got the most features, and its the 
biggest so you are able to fill the car up with a bunch of stuff.
