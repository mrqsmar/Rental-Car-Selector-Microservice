Ah yes, you have picked the Midsize Luxury Car class. What luxury... This class has the 
Acura TLX Tech, BMW 530i, Cadillac CT5 Premium Luxury, Genesis G80, Lexus ES350 Premium, 
MB E350. This class doesn't have too many cars but there all pretty good. I would pick the 
530i. Its the combination of Sport, Luxury and class. The CT5 has the most features but the car
is heavy and not super sporty. The G80 is the best styled but it drives like a boat. The Lexus
and Acura are both a bit cheaper options. So I would go with the 530i
