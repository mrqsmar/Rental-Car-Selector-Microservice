This is the fullsize pickup truck, be ready to do big tasks and to drive higher than anyone else!
You can choose from the Chevrolet Silverado LT, Ford F-150 XLT, RAM 1500 and Toyota Tundra SR5.
I would honestly go for the RAM 1500, you can try to get the Limited or Rebel version. The 
Rebel is very offroad oriented, and the Limited is as nice as a BMW 7 series.
