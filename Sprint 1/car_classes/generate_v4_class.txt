You have landed at the Muscle Car group. These cars range from the classic 3.
Chevy Camaro, Dodge Challenger and Ford Mustang.
All 3 are honestly kind of the same, but I would try to get a V8 model,
so these are 2SS, R/T and GT versions, respectively. But I would go with
the Mustang or Camaro since the Challenger is a pain to park
