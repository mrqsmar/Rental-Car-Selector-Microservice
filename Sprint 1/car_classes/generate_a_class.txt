You have chosen an Economy Car
Therefore you will be getting a Chevrolet Spark 1LT or a Mitsubishi Mirage
If they let you pick, take the Spark, but usually you will get upgraded to a Midsized (C) car.
The Spark beats out the Mirage because the Spark feels more modern and the Mirage is 
rated one of the worst cars according to multiple journalists in the automotive
industry.
