The Compact Luxury SUV class is interesting, there aren't too many offerings but there is one that I would like to note.
The options are Acura RDX, Audi Q3/Q5, BMW X3, Cadillac XT4, Genesis GX70, Infiniti QX50, Land Rover Range Rover Evoque, Lexus NX300, 
and Volvo XC40
There all pretty good cars, but I would probably go with the Audi Q5. The Q5 is the most luxurious and comes with a 
roof rack with rails if you need to haul stuff. It also has the nicest interior of the bunch.
