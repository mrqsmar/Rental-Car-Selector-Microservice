Ahh, you have reached the most popular class of car. The
5 Passenger SUV class, you can choose from so many cars...
Buick Envision, Chevrolet Equinox LT, Ford Escape Activ, 
Ford Edge SEL/Titanium, Honda CR-V LX, Hyundai Santa Fe SEL,
Hyundai Tucson, Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited, Mazda CX-5 Premium, Mazda CX-50, Nissan Rogue SV,
Subaru Forester Premium, Toyota RAV4, VW Tiguan SE.
Each car is very different from eachother so it comes down to preference,
but I would pick from either the Mazda offerings, the Nissan Rogue and the CR-V.
The Mazda packs a lot of features and is a very attractive and 
rare offering, the Nissan Rogue is the all around go getter, and the 
CR-V is the most utilitarian of the bunch.
