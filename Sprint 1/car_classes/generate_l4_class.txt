The 7 passenger class is one where you wanna haul
a family but don't wanna be seen in a Minivan.
This class includes the Chevrolet Traverse, Dodge Durango, Ford Explorer Limited,
Hyundai Palisade SEL, Jeep Grand Cherokee L, Kia Sorento EX, Mazda CX-90 Select,
Nissan Pathfinder SV, Toyota Highlander XLE, VW Atlas.
The takeaway is to take the Durango, why? Because its got a huge HEMI
V8. This car will make everyone in your household have so much fun and the car
is well equipped with Leather, Heated/Cooled seats and has very good practicality.
