Ahh, the Midsize Luxury SUV class. This class has so many great options that 
you will be able to be happy with any of these. They are the Alfa Romeo Stelvio, Audi Q7 Premium Plus, 
BMW X5 s40, Cadillac XT5 Premium Luxury, Infiniti QX60, Land Rover Range Rover Sport, Lexus RX350 F-Sport, and Volvo XC60.
Skip the QX60 and the Stelvio, as both are extremely dated. But my pick would be either the Q7 or the X5.
The Q7 is good if you need to carry 7 people and the X5 feels very 
luxurious, modern and the fleet versions give you a plethora of features
