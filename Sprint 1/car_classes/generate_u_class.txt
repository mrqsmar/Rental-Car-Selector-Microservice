The convertible class is there for those ultra hot days, and are variable. You can get muscle cars
like the Chevrolet Camaro or Ford Mustang, and you can get the BMW 430ci or the Mercedes C/E Convertibles.
I would not go for a Camaro or Mustang convertible and just go for the luxury convertibles. These
tend to be much more luxurious and well taken care of. If you spot an E convertible, thats the best.
