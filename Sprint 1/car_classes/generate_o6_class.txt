This is the midsize pickup truck class. These trucks aren't the most utilitarian but are small enough so
you feel like your driving more of a car than an actual big truck. The options are the Chevrolet Colorado LT,
GMC Canyon SLE, Nissan Frontier SV and the Toyota Tacoma TRD Offroad. The Tacoma is the best shot.
Its got the most offroad gear just in case you want to take it to the trail, plus its got a nice V6
