You have chosen an electric car... Unfortunately this class of car tends to be 
phasing out due to rental car agencies selling out their electric cars
due to the vast amount of customers having troubles with charging, left stranded
and some caught on fire. If fuel economy is a concern, I would pick the
Hybrid. But if you are really stringent on an electric vehicle, the 
Chevy Bolt 1LT, Hyundai Ioniq5, Kia Niro EV, Kia EV6 Wind, Nissan Ariya, 
Subaru Solterra Premium, Toyota bZ4x, Tesla 3 and Y are options.
I would take the Ioniq5. It has more range than a Tesla Model Y, and the 
car is significantly more reliable. Don't pick the Bolt, its got severe range
anxiety. The Niro and EV6 aren't terrible options, but are have lower range. 
The Solterra and Bz4X and Ariya all have horrendous visability. The 3 and Y have
major reliability issues that would be a pain to have as a rental car.
