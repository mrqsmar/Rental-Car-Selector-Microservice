You have chosen a Small Car
Therefore you will be getting a Chevrolet Sonic LT, Ford Fiesta SE, Toyota Yaris or 
Nissan Versa SV. 
Most likely, you will end up with a Versa as they are very popular and quite 
good cars, I would take a Versa if I was you since it recently has been redesigned.
The Sonic, Yaris and Fiesta are extremely dated. All are somewhat sporty options.
