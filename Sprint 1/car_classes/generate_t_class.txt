You have hit the Large SUV class. These get pretty bad fuel economy but tend to be 
more spacious and have more space than a typical 7 passenger SUV. 
The offerings are the Chevrolet Tahoe Premier, Ford Expedition XLT,
GMC Yukon Denali, and Jeep Wagoneer III. These cars are all pretty good
but I would go with the Wagoneer. its got the most features, and its the 
biggest so you are able to fill the car up with a bunch of stuff.
