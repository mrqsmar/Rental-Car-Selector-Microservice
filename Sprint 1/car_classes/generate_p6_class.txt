The Fullsize Luxury SUV Class gives you the best of the best for SUV's. The options here are vast.
You can choose the BMW X7, Cadillac Escalade, Jeep Grand Wagoneer, Land Rover Range Rover, Maserati Grecale,
MB GLS550, Infiniti QX80 Luxe, Volvo XC90. The XC90 is pretty basic for the class so I would say no.
The Infiniti QX80 is very dated. I would definitely pick the Range Rover, as its the most luxurious by far.
