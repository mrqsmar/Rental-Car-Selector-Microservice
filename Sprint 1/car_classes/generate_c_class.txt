You have chosen an Intermediate/Mid-Size Car
Therefore you will be getting a Honda Civic LX, Hyundai Elantra SE, Nissan Sentra SV
Toyota Corolla LE, Subaru Impreza
Most likely, you will end up with a Corolla, however if they let you, take the Civic, it has a bit more
features and its got a more powerful engine. 
The Corolla is a great car, but its pretty bland. Most of the fleet Impreza's are a bit beat up and
they tend to have very little features. The Sentras the newest offering, and tends to have 
more features, but is very unrefined.
