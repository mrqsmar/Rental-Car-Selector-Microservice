You have selected a Premium Car! This class involves the Chevrolet Impala LS,
Chrysler 300, Dodge Charger SE, Honda Accord Hybrid, Nissan Maxima SV, Toyota Avalon XLE,
and Toyota Crown XLE. The Chrysler 300/Dodge Charger are essentially twins that are
being outdated and a lot of the ones there are very beat up. The Accords in Rental fleets are typically
not well equipped. The Maxima is well equipped but sits very low to the ground. The Toyota Avalon 
and the Maxima are similar, but the Avalon is much more refined. The Crown is a hybrid and 
comes well equipped. I would pick the Crown or Avalon. Crown for efficiency or 
Avalon for a bit more power.
