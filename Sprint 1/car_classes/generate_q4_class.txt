You have chosen a Small SUV. These SUV's consist of the 
Chevy Trax, Honda HR-V, Hyundai Kona, Mazda CX-30 Select, 
Toyota Corolla X LE, Mitsubishi Outlander Sport, 
VW Taos. All of these options are so-so, and I'm sure the 
company can get you into a Nissan Rogue, but I would go with
the CX-30. The rest of the options are very boring, especially
the Trax and HR-V. But the CX-30 is more luxurious and also
zips places pretty fast.
