You have chosen a Full-Size Sedan, the most common vehicle is the Chevrolet Malibu
However, its not very reliable, and you should pick the Toyota Camry SE or Hyundai Sonata SEL
These two are much nicer and are more reliable, but the VW Passat is the sportiest
Other options are the Nissan Altima, Ford Fusion, Mazda6 and VW Passat SE. The Altima always
comes in every trim configuration. The Fusion is pretty old, but
is a pretty solid rental car. The Passat is the most feature packed.
