# Rental Car Selector Microservice

This program fuses 4 microservices that helps specify what kind of rental the user wants. The default program has the user get a default choice rental car after looking at the rental car codes.
One microservice has a rewards program service that selects a special car for the user if they are in a rewards system with the agency. The second microservice asks the user for passenger count,
and then the user gets a rental car according to their passenger count. The fourth was a manager special, which is a wild card and randomly gives the user a car with no input.

I used Python for the code, and then this application is ran on a CLI interface.
